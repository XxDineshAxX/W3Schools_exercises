<h1>Blockquote</h1>
<blockquote>
    <p>Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.
        The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.
        Faith is taking the first step even when you don't see the whole staircase.</p>
